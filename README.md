This is Cathy a xmms2 client 
============================

Cathy was my girlfriend at 15 she died just short of 19 (in 1982) I still miss her.

The Cathy client is a reasonably complete client. It can add and delete playlists and collections, and basically do all the xmms2 things.


I have built deb files for it using checkinstall but one day I might do a proper one.

Cathy is built in
