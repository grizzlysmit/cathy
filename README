This is Cathy a xmms2 client 
============================

Cathy was my girlfriend at 15 she died just short of 19 (in 1982) I still miss her.

The Cathy client is a reasonably complete client. It can add and delete playlists and collections, and basically do all the xmms2 things.

I have built deb files for it using checkinstall but one day I might do a proper one.

Cathy is built in C++20 
using libglib2.0-0,libgtkmm-3.0-1v5,libgtkmm-3.0-dev,libxmmsclient++-dev,libxmmsclient++-glib-dev
and {fmt}
